# What is a Complex System?



Complex systems are networks made of a number of components that interact with each other, typically in a nonlinear fashion. Complex systems may arise and evolve through self-organization, such that they are neither completely regular nor completely random, permitting the development of emergent behavior at macroscopic scales. - Sayama

*A Nonlinear System is subject to irreversibility, such that given some change in the inputs to the system, undoing the change does not necessarily return the system to its start, whereas all linear systems are reversible. Furthermore nonlinear systems can be subject to discontinuous or catastrophic state changes, which is not possible in linear systems.*
