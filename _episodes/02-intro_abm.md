# Agent-Based Modelling


> An agent-based model (ABM) is a computational model for simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous agents (both individual or collective entities such as organizations or groups) in order to understand the behavior of a system and what governs its outcomes.

# Why use an agent-based model

| Pros | Cons |
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| Captures emergent phenomena | Randomness is random | 
| Provides a natural description of a system | Models need serve a purpose | 
| Flexible | Large interactions can be computationally intensive | 
| Low cost and time saving approach |  |
