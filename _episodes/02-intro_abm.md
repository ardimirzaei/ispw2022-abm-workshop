# Agent-Based Modelling

> An agent-based model (ABM) is a computational model for simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous agents (both individual or collective entities such as organizations or groups) in order to understand the behavior of a system and what governs its outcomes.

# Why use an agent-based model

| Pros | Cons |
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| Captures emergent phenomena | Randomness is random | 
| Provides a natural description of a system | Models need serve a purpose | 
| Flexible | Large interactions can be computationally intensive | 
| Low cost and time saving approach |  |

# Applications of ABM



# Describe the steps for development of an agent-based model

1. Designing the model
2. Constructing model
3. Examination of the model

## Styles
Two major styles:
- Phenomena-based modelling
- Exploratory modelling

## Stages in designing ABM
1. Choosing a question
2. Choosing your agents
3. Agent properties
4. Environment characteristics and stationary agents
5. Agent behaviour
6. Designing the Time Step
7. Choosing parameters of the model
8. Choosing your measures

## Constructing
ABM design principle:start simple and gradually add complexity.

## Examination of Model

–Statistical analysis of the results
–Evaluation the results and connection with the driving question/hypothesis
–Verification and validation
