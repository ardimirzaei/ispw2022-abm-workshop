# Agent-Based Modelling

> An agent-based model (ABM) is a computational model for simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous agents (both individual or collective entities such as organizations or groups) in order to understand the behavior of a system and what governs its outcomes.

# Why use an agent-based model

| Pros | Cons |
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| Captures emergent phenomena | Randomness is random | 
| Provides a natural description of a system | Models need serve a purpose | 
| Flexible | Large interactions can be computationally intensive | 
| Low cost and time saving approach |  |

1. Hypothesis Specification
2. Model Development
3. Model Validation

## 1. Hypothesis Specification

Two major styles:
- Phenomena-based modelling
- Exploratory modelling

## Stages in designing ABM

1. Choosing a question
2. Choosing your agents
3. Agent properties
4. Environment characteristics and stationary agents
5. Agent behaviour
6. Designing the Time Step
7. Choosing parameters of the model
8. Choosing your measures

## 2. Model Development

ABM design principle:start simple and gradually add complexity.

## 3. Model Validation

- Statistical analysis of the results
- Evaluation the results and connection with the driving question/hypothesis
- Verification and validation
