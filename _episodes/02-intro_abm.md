# Agent-Based Modelling


> An agent-based model (ABM) is a computational model for simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous agents (both individual or collective entities such as organizations or groups) in order to understand the behavior of a system and what governs its outcomes. 
> <cite>[Agent-based Model - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model)</cite>

# Why use an agent-based model

| Pros | Cons |
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| Captures emergent phenomena | Randomness is random | 
| Provides a natural description of a system | Models need serve a purpose | 
| Flexible | Large interactions can be computationally intensive | 
| Low cost and time saving approach |  |

# Applications of ABM



# Describe the steps for development of an agent-based model

1)Designing the model
2)Constructing model
3)Examination of the model

## Styles
Two major styles
–Phenomena-based modelling
–Exploratory modelling

## Stages in designing ABM
1.Choosing a question
2.Choosing your agents
3.Agent properties
4.Environment characteristics and stationary agents
5.Agent behaviour
6.Designing the Time Step
7.Choosing parameters of the model
8.Choosing your measures

## Constructing
ABM design principle:start simple and gradually add complexity.

## Examination of Model

–Statistical analysis of the results
–Evaluation the results and connection with the driving question/hypothesis
–Verification and validation
