> Run through sheep wolf example. 

- The sliders and how everything works 
- Use the sliders to set conditions, the number of agents, their behaviour, their interactions, thwir external environment. 
- thought experiment what type of conditions do we want to set (drought conditions, fertile fields... )
- See how they interact and they change, but how do we express the output. Population of the 3 agents.
