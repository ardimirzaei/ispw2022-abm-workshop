# Hoteling’s Law
- something broadly related to pharmacy
- explain hoetlings law. 
- economic law???


# Applications to Pharmacy

- think of a market in pharmacy
- different pharmcies have a different look and feel
- show images of different pharamcies (TW, cwh, 777, ....)
- Hoestling law is that in a economic market segment that often it pays to look very similar.

# NetLogo Model

Each consumer adds up the price and distance from each store, and then chooses to go to the store that offers the lowest sum. In the event of a tie, the consumer chooses randomly. The stores can either be constrained to one dimension, in which case all stores operate on a line, or they can be placed on a plane. Under the normal rule, each store tries to move randomly in the four cardinal directions to see if it can gain a larger market share; if not, it does not move. Then each store checks if it can earn a greater profit by increasing or decreasing the price of their goods; if not, it does not change the price. This decision is made without any knowledge of their competitors' strategies. There are two other conditions under which one can run this model: stores can either only change prices, or only move their location.

- set initial conditions of the number of stores. 
- modify price
- modify location
- look at revenue


## Activities

- Adjust the paramaters 
- scenario 1: cannot change price (regulated scripts)
- secnario 2: cannot move (aus pharmacy location rules)
- - how thesse affect revenue?
- specualte what would happen if they were free to move and free to set their prices.

> Try to see how stores behave differently when they are either prohibited from moving or changing their prices.
> Try increasing the number of stores. Examine how they behave differently and watch which ones are the most successful. What patterns emerge?
