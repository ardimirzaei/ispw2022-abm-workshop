# Introduction

Modelling complex, interrelated and interacting components of human behavior is challenging. A complex-system modelling approach through agent-based modelling (ABM) can help address the challenge. ABM’s allow a user to model individual behaviors that can lead to population level effects (Silverman et al., 2021). ABM’s allow for the interaction of individual agents, within an environment. Simple ABM’s involve agents that behaviour similarly. ABMs may also be developed with heterogenous agents. Manipulation of microspecifications allow researchers to use an ABM to explore how agent interaction and reaction to the environment lead to macroscopic outcomes. Accordingly, ABMs can be used experimentally to falsify hypothesized mechanisms that bring about observed system outcomes, thereby facilitating theory development of human behavior.

## Aim
The aim of this workshop is to provide an introduction to agent-based modelling as a method for simulation of behavior. 

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:
-	Identify characteristics of a complex system
-	Describe the features of an agent-based model
-	Describe the steps for development of an agent-based model 
-	Conduct a simple experiment using an ABM
