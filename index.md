# Background:
Modelling complex, interrelated and interacting components of human behavior is challenging. A complex-system modelling approach through agent-based modelling (ABM) can help address the challenge. ABM’s allow a user to model individual behaviors that can lead to population level effects (Silverman et al., 2021). ABM’s allow for the interaction of individual agents, within an environment. Simple ABM’s involve agents that behaviour similarly. ABMs may also be developed with heterogenous agents. Manipulation of microspecifications allow researchers to use an ABM to explore how agent interaction and reaction to the environment lead to macroscopic outcomes. Accordingly, ABMs can be used experimentally to falsify hypothesized mechanisms that bring about observed system outcomes, thereby facilitating theory development of human behavior.

## Aim:
The aim of this workshop is to provide an introduction to agent-based modelling as a method for simulation of behavior. 

## Learning Objectives:
By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:
-	Identify characteristics of a complex system
-	Describe the features of an agent-based model
-	Describe the steps for development of an agent-based model 
-	Conduct a simple experiment using an ABM

> ## Prerequisites
>
> You must have competency on the Unix/Linux command line. If you are interested in learning HPC but have no Unix/Linux command-line skills, you MUST first take an [Introduction to Unix/Linux](https://intersect.org.au/training/course/unix) course, followed by [‘_Introduction to Artemis HPC_’]({{ site.sih_pages }}/training.artemis.interhpc).
>
>You should be able to read and write basic Python scripts.
>
> You are assumed to have your own Artemis account, know how to connect to Artemis, navigate its filesystem, and submit jobs to the PBS Scheduler. If you are not familiar with HPC, you should take [‘_Introduction to Artemis HPC_’]({{ site.sih_pages }}/training.artemis.interhpc) before attempting this course. This will teach you the basic requirements around HPC environments.
